# Riftbound Engine

A rules-enforced, headless 1v1 engine for the Riftbound TCG (Riot Games).
Solo portfolio project. TypeScript on Node, test-driven.

## Scope (current phase)

Headless engine only — no UI, no networking, no deckbuilder.

## Data source

Card data is sourced from community-published projects, not Riot's
official API (whose developer terms prohibit gameplay-simulation use).
See `/reference` for provenance notes.

## Scripts

- `npm test` — run the test suite once
- `npm run test:watch` — run tests in watch mode
- `npm run typecheck` — type-check without emitting
